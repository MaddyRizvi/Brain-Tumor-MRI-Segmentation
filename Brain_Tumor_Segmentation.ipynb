    "# \n",
    "# Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an advanced imaging technique that is used to observe a variety of diseases and parts of the body. \n",
    "# \n",
    "# As we will see later, neural networks can analyze these images individually (as a radiologist would) or combine them into a single 3D volume to make predictions.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# At a high level, MRI works by measuring the radio waves emitting by atoms subjected to a magnetic field. \n",

    "# We often encounter MR images in the [DICOM format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DICOM). \n",
    "# - The DICMO format is the output format for most commercial MRI scanners. This type of data can be processed using the [pydicom](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/getting_started.html) Python library. \n",
    "# \n",
    "# In this Project, we will be using the data from the [Decathlon 10 Challenge](https://decathlon-10.grand-challenge.org). This data has been mostly pre-processed for the competition participants, however in real practice, MRI data needs to be significantly pre-preprocessed before we can use it to train our models.\n",

    "# \n",
    "# The first file is an image file containing a 4D array of MR image in the shape of (240, 240, 155, 4). \n",
    "# -  The first 3 dimensions are the X, Y, and Z values for each point in the 3D volume, which is commonly called a voxel. \n",

    "# \n",
    "# ##### Generate sub-volumes\n",
    "# \n",
    "# We are going to first generate \"patches\" of our data which you can think of as sub-volumes of the whole MR images. \n",
    "# - The reason that we are generating patches is because a network that can process the entire volume at once will simply not fit inside our current environment's memory/GPU.\n",
    "# - Therefore we will be using this common technique to generate spatially consistent sub-volumes of our data, which can be fed into our network.\n",
    "# - Specifically, we will be generating randomly sampled sub-volumes of shape \\[160, 160, 16\\] from our images. \n",
    "# - Furthermore, given that a large portion of the MRI volumes are just brain tissue or black background without any tumors, we want to make sure that we pick patches that at least include some amount of tumor data. \n",
    "# - Therefore, we are only going to pick patches that have at most 95% non-tumor regions (so at least 5% tumor). \n",
    "# - We do this by filtering the volumes based on the values present in the background labels.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# ##### Standardization (mean 0, stdev 1)\n",
    "# \n",
    "# Lastly, given that the values in MR images cover a very wide range, we will standardize the values to have a mean of zero and standard deviation of 1. \n",
    "# - This is a common technique in deep image processing since standardization makes it much easier for the network to learn.\n",
    "# \n",
